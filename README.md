# Sensor System

The sensor system developed by David Blum during his internship.

Contains an Arduino (C++) project for reading temperature and humidity measurements.
A C# ASP.NET Core Web API that manages those measurements.
And a small website (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) that retrieves those measurements from the Web API and displays them.
